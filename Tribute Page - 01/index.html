                <h4>Artistic career and chronicles of Frida Kahlo:</h4>

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;She was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works
                    inspired by
                    the
                    nature and artifacts
                    of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture her paintings often had strong autobiographical
                    elements and mixed
                    realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which
                    sought to define a
                    Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is known for
                    painting about her
                    experience of chronic pain.</p>

                    and her first self portrait, a subject to
                    which she would return on numerous occasions throughout her lifetime. In this self-portrait, Frida
                    was wearing a wine-red velvet dress and looks like a princess in it. This painting she used as a
                    token of love to regain the affection from her lover. She started working on this painting
                    during the late summer of 1926 when her relationship with Alejandro is turning sour because

                    Kahlo's political attitudes. In this painting, a
                    few people are sitting side by side on a wooden bench of a rickety bus. They are representatives of
                    different classes of
                    Mexican society. This painting is also a depiction of the bus accident which happened in 1925 and
                    changed her life forever. "I suffered
                    two grave accidents in my life," Frida Kahlo once said. "One in which a streetcar knocked me down. .
                    . . The other
                    accident is Diego." Diego and Frida's union was both carnal and comradely. The most powerful bond
                    between the two is
                    their admiration for each other's art. Diego is the greatest artist to her and she called him the
                    "architect of life."
                    To Diego, Frida was "a diamond in the midst of many inferior jewels" and "the best painter of her
                    epoch."</li>
